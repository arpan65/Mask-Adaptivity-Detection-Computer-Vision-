# Mask-Adaptivity-Detection-Computer-Vision
Face mask rapidly became the symbol of COVID-19 pandemic with more than 50 countries making it compulsory. Countries emerging from lockdown are making it mandatory to wear a mask in public and to avail general services. Enforcing this new norm also brings new challenges to the agencies across the globe, i.e our security cameras are not equipped to track automatically if the social distancing and other precautionary measures are being followed or not. In this case study, our intention is to develop a solution to keep track the mask adaptivity of crowd, to track if most people are using a mask or not.
